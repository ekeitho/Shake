# Shake
409 Cloud Services project for Winter 2015 called Shake.
Is an app that allows you to find your friends that are near you by just shaking your phone.

The user must set their location to noticable for others to find them. Let's say for instance you got to school, but remembered it was daylight saving's time and you got there an hour earlier. You want to see who is around campus that you know, just by shaking your phone.
