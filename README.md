Technical Overview:

Coding Languages and why
    
    Java for Android Platform because it is the native language for the platform
    
Cloud Platform and why
    
    Parse for backend data storage
API structure and why
    
    Facebook Graph API to pull friends, create groups, and send requests because it is already well established and takes care of social connections
    Google Maps for maps and location services because it is already well established
    
Cloud Database used to store application data, and why.
    
    Parse for backend data storage because it is already used by Facebook API
    
Code repository used, and why.
    
    GitHub because itâ€™s what we used in class and is a very efficient subversion control system
